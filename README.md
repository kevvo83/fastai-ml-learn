# fastai-ml-learn

## Introduction

This repository stores all notebooks and notes while learning Deep Learning from the following providers and source material:

1. FastAI
    * [Practical Deep Learning for coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
     * All notebooks are implemented in PyTorch, Transformers or Tensorflow
       * While source material are in FastAI, I've used that only as a reference for technique
     * Part 1 - What I'm learning
       * NN from scratch (Titanic model on Kaggle)
       * [NLP and Transformers](https://github.com/kevvo83/fastai-ml-learn/blob/main/Fast.ai%20Lesson%204%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Transformers.ipynb)
         * Additional Reference: [Iterate like a Grandmaster on NLP work](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/iterate-like-a-grandmaster/#Training)
       * CNNs(https://github.com/kevvo83/fastai-ml-learn/blob/main/Fast.ai%20-%20Road%20to%20the%20Top%201%2C%202%2C%203%2C%204.ipynb)
         * Additional Reference: [Road to the top - CNNs](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/first-steps-road-to-the-top-part-1)

3. HuggingFace
  * LLMs and RAG
    * References:
      * [Simple/Naive RAG](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/rag_zephyr_langchain)
      * [Advanced RAG](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/advanced_rag)
